Next, we will try to visualize how documents are generated by LDA. Let's assume that our vocabulary consists of the following ten words:

{üçå,ü•ù,üçã,üçì,üçÖ,üê•,üêñ,üêë,üêä,ü¶ì}

and that each document will consist of only 5 words. To visualize the generative process of LDA, we will show both the topic distribution and the word distribution per topic, in two separate `BarChart`s. The Topic distribution will be the same as what we did before

```python
BarChart(
    values=[0,0],
    bar_names=['animals', 'food'],
    y_axis_config={"font_size": 36},
    y_length=3,
    x_length=5,
    y_range=[0, 0.6, 0.1],
)
```

Unfortunately, for the word distribution, we cannot pass a list of emojis to `bar_names` and has to be added manually one by one in the correct spot. We create a helper function for this:

```python
def add_svg_x_ticks(bar_chart):
    """
    Adds svg symbols instead of standard x-ticks to a BarChart
    """
    for i, svg in enumerate(sum(words.values(), [])):
        symbol = SVGMobject("icons/" + svg, width=0.4)
        symbol.next_to(histogram[0][i], DOWN, buff=0.3, aligned_edge=DOWN)
        histogram.add(symbol)
```

Here, we load an SVG symbol from disk using `symbol = SVGMobject("icons/" + svg, width=0.4)` and move it right below the corresponding bar of the `BarChart`. The `BarChart` consists of ten bars, and the "ith" bar, can be referenced with `bar_chart[0][i]`.  Using `.next_to()` we move each symbol below each respective bar. 

To illustrate the random picking of topics and words, we add two `Arrow`s to the scene

```python
arrow_topic = Line(ORIGIN, DOWN * 0.8).add_tip().set_color(BLUE)
arrow_word = Line(ORIGIN, DOWN * 0.8).add_tip().set_color(BLUE)
```

which draws a small vertical line and `.add_tip()` adds an arrowhead to it. These arrows will appear, disappear and move around to illustrate which topic and which word was picked during the random picking process. 

We start the animation by sampling from a Dirichlet distribution to obtain the topic distribution and word distribution per topic:

```python
topic_p = scipy.stats.dirichlet(self.alphas_topics).rvs(1)[0]

word_p1 = scipy.stats.dirichlet(self.alphas_words_topic1).rvs(1)[0]
word_p2 = scipy.stats.dirichlet(self.alphas_words_topic2).rvs(1)[0]

word_p = np.concatenate((word_p1, word_p2))
```

and initialize the animation by letting each bar transform from zero to its initial value

```python
self.play(
    histogram_topic.animate.change_bar_values(topic_p),
    histogram_words.animate.change_bar_values(word_p),
)
```

Next, we would like to randomly choose a topic from the topic distribution and visualize the choice using the arrow.
